7.2 Types of Testing Used
1) Manual Testing: In the manual test, we used the machine coding tool to write all the
codes. After writing each code, we have run the code in the local server of the
machine, and then check whether it runs. We have made the API and manually tested it
in the postman tool and checked whether all the APIs are working well. It works well,
so we add this code to your project file and connect to the front-end code.
2) Unit Testing: In the unit test, we have tested the back-end code on the local server of
the computer, and the code can run, and then we checked whether all APIs are working
properly. Here, we connect all the backend code to the front-end code, and checked
whether the login, registration, add/delete, and update functions are operating normally
after clicking the button.
3) API Testing: In this test, we checked whether all APIS of voters, candidates, and
administrators are running well, or what type of exception is given, and we have
resolved all exceptions
